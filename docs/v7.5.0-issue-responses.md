### Issue #663: Support Nvidia parakeet for local transcription
**Author:** @rodalpho
**Issue Text:**
> I use Nvidia Parakeet for local transcription in a fork of WhisperWriter I amateurishly vibe-hacked together on Windows.
>
> Parakeet transcription is absolutely *instantaneous*. It is way, way faster than Groq and comes in 4th on the HF ASR leaderboard with only 600M parameters.
>
> Feature request is to support Parakeet for local transcription, no Speaches server, just fully integrated. I believe this would be the holy grail, for English anyway.

Hey @rodalpho, thank you for the issue, and good news! [Whispering v7.5.0](https://github.com/epicenter-md/epicenter/releases/tag/v7.5.0) now includes full support for NVIDIA Parakeet! 🎉

You were absolutely right about Parakeet being the holy grail for English transcription. The Parakeet TDT 0.6B v3 model is now fully integrated for local transcription - no Speaches server needed. It's ~670MB, uses GPU acceleration when available, and as you noted, it's absolutely instantaneous. Users have been calling it "magic"!

The model selector now handles both Whisper and Parakeet models from one unified interface. This was made possible by migrating from `whisper-rs` to [`transcribe-rs`](https://github.com/cjpais/transcribe-rs), which gives us a consistent API for multiple transcription engines.

Thank you for the inspiration to add this feature!

### Issue #767: [BUG] [Windows] Transcriptions very slow and oversized since 7.4.0
**Author:** @Arche151
**Issue Text:**
> Transcriptions take forever since 7.4.0 (maybe already in 7.3.1). After stopping a recording, it can take 30 seconds before the transcription result is received, which makes the app unusable.
>
> I also wasn't able to transcribe a 1m16s audio because it was reported as larger than 25 MB, even with maximum compression enabled.
>
> Rolling back to 7.3.0 immediately fixed all issues (speed, file size, and length).

**Drafted Response:**
```markdown
Hey @Arche151, so sorry to hear you experienced these issues! Good news - [Whispering v7.5.0](https://github.com/epicenter-md/epicenter/releases/tag/v7.5.0) fixes both the slow transcription and file size problems you encountered.

The slow transcription issue was caused by GPU acceleration problems in `whisper-rs`. We've completely migrated to [`transcribe-rs`](https://github.com/cjpais/transcribe-rs) which properly handles GPU acceleration on Windows. You should see transcription speeds back to normal (or even faster!).

For the file size issue, we've overhauled the local model download system to stream directly to disk (PR #808), and improved compression handling which should resolve the 25MB limit problems you were hitting.

Thank you for the detailed bug report - it really helped us track down these issues!

### Issue #746: Can't download from the suggested models, fails after 75%ish
**Author:** @alanmun
**Issue Text:**
> On Windows 11, it just turns into this no matter how many times I try to download large turbo model.
> [Shows error screenshot of failed download]

**Drafted Response:**
```markdown
Hey @alanmun, thank you for reporting this issue! Good news - [Whispering v7.5.0](https://github.com/epicenter-md/epicenter/releases/tag/v7.5.0) completely fixes the model download failures you were experiencing.

We've overhauled the entire local model download system (PR #808) to stream downloads directly to disk instead of loading them into memory first. This prevents the failures that were happening around 75% completion, especially with larger models like the large turbo you were trying to download.

The new system is much more reliable and can handle any model size without running into memory constraints. Please try downloading the models again with v7.5.0!

### Issue #775: Whispering - file access problem - blocks entire workflow of the application - Ubuntu 24.04
**Author:** @julweber
**Issue Text:**
> The problem first occured while trying to configure the local whisper.cpp model. I was not able to download the model in app -> Error: Failed to download model; forbidden path; /home/my_user/.local/share/com.bradenwong.whispering/whisper-models/ggml-tiny.bin
>
> Error when trying to record and transcribe: "Unable to read recording file. Please try again."
>
> I tested versions 7.4.0 and 7.3.0 AppImage on Ubuntu 24.04

**Drafted Response:**
```markdown
Hey @julweber, sorry to hear about these file access issues on Ubuntu! Good news - [Whispering v7.5.0](https://github.com/epicenter-md/epicenter/releases/tag/v7.5.0) includes several fixes that should resolve the problems you're experiencing.

The AppImage has been significantly improved with proper X11 dependencies added and Wayland stripped out (PR #805), which fixes many of the permission and file access issues on Ubuntu 24.04. Additionally, the model download system has been completely overhauled to handle file permissions more reliably.

The "forbidden path" and "Unable to read recording file" errors should now be resolved. The new version handles Linux file permissions much more gracefully.

Please try the latest v7.5.0 AppImage and let me know if you still encounter any issues!

### Issue #697: [BUG] Linux Audio Recording Fails - Zero Length Recordings with CPAL
**Author:** @lockmeister
**Issue Text:**
> Whispering v7.3.1 fails to record audio on modern Linux distributions using PipeWire, producing zero-length recordings despite successful device enumeration.
>
> Environment: Ubuntu 24.04 LTS, PipeWire audio system
> Symptoms: Recording appears to start successfully, UI shows recording in progress with timer, but produces audio files with 0.00 second duration

**Drafted Response:**
```markdown
Hey @lockmeister, thank you for the detailed bug report about PipeWire audio recording! [Whispering v7.5.0](https://github.com/epicenter-md/epicenter/releases/tag/v7.5.0) includes several changes that may help with the zero-length recording issue.

We've made significant improvements to Linux compatibility, including:
- Added proper X11 dependencies and removed Wayland components (PR #805)
- Migrated from `whisper-rs` to `transcribe-rs` which may handle audio capture differently

### Issue #670: Microphone access fails on Fedora 42 KDE (no permission prompt)
**Author:** (check author)
**Issue Text:**
> [No permission prompt for microphone on Fedora]

**Drafted Response:**
```markdown
Hey [author], [Whispering v7.5.0](https://github.com/epicenter-md/epicenter/releases/tag/v7.5.0) includes Linux improvements that might help with the microphone permission issue on Fedora.

We've improved Linux compatibility with proper X11 dependencies (PR #805) and better FFmpeg integration (PR #804) which provides an alternative recording method if the native method fails to get permissions.

1. Running with `--no-sandbox` flag
2. Using FFmpeg as the recording method
3. Manually granting microphone permissions through KDE settings

Let me know if this helps!

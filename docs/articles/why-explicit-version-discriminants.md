# Why Epicenter Makes You Type \_v in Every Write

Epicenter makes you type `_v: 2` in every versioned table write. We explored three different approaches, an auto-injection system, and a "start simple, add later" pattern before landing here. The explicit `_v` survived because it solved a problem the alternatives couldn't: one pattern, no ambiguity, greppable version bumps.

## Three Approaches, One Problem

We started with three ways to version table schemas. All worked. All had trade-offs. Documentation had to explain all three, and new users asked "which one?" The answer was always "it depends," which is a sign the API hasn't made up its mind.

**Field presence** was the simplest. Check whether a field exists:

```typescript
const posts = defineTable()
	.version(type({ id: 'string', title: 'string' }))
	.version(type({ id: 'string', title: 'string', views: 'number' }))
	.migrate((row) => {
		if (!('views' in row)) return { ...row, views: 0 };
		return row;
	});
```

This works for two versions. It breaks down at three: what if you add a field in v2 and remove one in v3? Or add an optional field that could legitimately be missing? Structural checks become fragile fast.

**Asymmetric \_v** was the recommended default. Start without `_v`, add it when you need a second version:

```typescript
const posts = defineTable()
	.version(type({ id: 'string', title: 'string' }))
	.version(type({ id: 'string', title: 'string', views: 'number', _v: '2' }))
	.migrate((row) => {
		if (!('_v' in row)) return { ...row, views: 0, _v: 2 };
		return row;
	});
```

Less ceremony upfront, which felt like a win. But it introduced a trap: v1 data has no `_v` field, so the migration checks `!('_v' in row)`. If you forget that check, v1 data silently passes through unmigrated. And every version after v1 uses a different migration pattern than v1 itself.

**Symmetric \_v** was the clean option. Include `_v` from the start:

```typescript
const posts = defineTable()
	.version(type({ id: 'string', title: 'string', _v: '1' }))
	.version(type({ id: 'string', title: 'string', views: 'number', _v: '2' }))
	.migrate((row) => {
		switch (row._v) {
			case 1:
				return { ...row, views: 0, _v: 2 };
			case 2:
				return row;
		}
	});
```

Every version follows the same pattern. Migration is a switch statement. TypeScript narrows the union. But it requires `_v` in every schema and every write call, which looked like unnecessary boilerplate for tables that might never need a second version.

## The Auto-Injection Detour

We explored a fourth option: have the library inject `_v` automatically. Instead of putting `_v` in your schema, you'd pass a version tag as the first argument:

```typescript
// Proposed (not shipped)
const posts = defineTable()
	.version(1, type({ id: 'string', title: 'string' }))
	.version(2, type({ id: 'string', title: 'string', views: 'number' }))
	.migrate((row) => {
		if (row._v === 1) return { ...row, views: 0 };
		return row;
	});

// Writes would omit _v entirely
posts.set({ id: '1', title: 'Hello', views: 0 });
// Stored as: { id: '1', title: 'Hello', views: 0, _v: 2 }
```

Zero `_v` boilerplate. The library handles everything. We wrote a full spec for this, got deep into the type system design, and then deferred it. Three reasons:

It's magic. What you write isn't what gets stored. When you inspect raw data in Y.js, there's a `_v` field you never defined. That makes debugging harder.

The industry doesn't do this. Zod discriminated unions, TypeScript tagged unions, Effect schema variants: they all expect the discriminant in the schema itself. Auto-injection invents a new convention that users have to unlearn elsewhere.

It creates asymmetry. Tables would get auto-injected `_v`, but KV stores wouldn't (they don't need it). Two different mental models for the same library.

## One Pattern Wins

We dropped three approaches down to one: symmetric `_v` from v1. If your table has versions, every version includes `_v`. Every write includes `_v`. Every migration uses `switch (row._v)`.

The "start simple" argument for asymmetric `_v` lost out to a simpler observation: most tables never need versioning at all. The shorthand `defineTable(schema)` handles single-version tables with zero ceremony. The moment you need two versions, you're already opting into the builder pattern with `.version().migrate()`. Adding `_v` at that point is one field per schema, not a burden.

## The DX Reframe

The `_v: 2` in every `set()` call looked like a tax. Then we realized it's a workflow:

| Scenario           | With explicit \_v                 | With auto-injected \_v      |
| ------------------ | --------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Adding v3          | Grep `_v: 2` → every write site   | Trace call sites manually   |
| Code review        | See which version a write targets | Hidden behind library magic |
| Debugging raw data | `_v` matches what code wrote      | `_v` appears from nowhere   |

When you bump to v3, search your codebase for `_v: 2`. Every hit is a call site that needs updating. The "boilerplate" is a searchable version marker that makes version bumps mechanical.

## \_v Goes Last

Convention, not enforced. Business fields first, system metadata last:

```typescript
type({ id: 'string', title: 'string', views: 'number', _v: '2' });
posts.set({ id: '1', title: 'Hello', views: 0, _v: 2 });
```

You see what the row IS, then what version it IS. The `_v` at the end reads like a footnote, not a headline.

## One Less Thing to Remember

We also confirmed that `as const` on `_v` values in migrate returns is unnecessary. TypeScript contextually narrows `2` to the literal type when the return type expects `_v: 2`. One less annotation to remember.

One pattern, explicit, greppable. That's the bet.

## Enforced at the Type Level

We didn't stop at documentation. In [PR #1366](https://github.com/EpicenterHQ/epicenter/pull/1366), we changed the table generic constraint from `CombinedStandardSchema<{ id: string }>` to `CombinedStandardSchema<{ id: string; _v: number }>`. Passing a table schema without `_v` to `defineTable()` is now a compile error.

This closed the loop: `_v` went from "recommended" to "the only way." The pattern taxonomy — field presence, asymmetric `_v`, symmetric `_v` — disappeared from the docs entirely. There's one pattern for tables. KV stores stay flexible since they're small objects where field presence is unambiguous.

The change was zero-risk because every table schema already had `_v: 1` from the same PR. The type enforcement just prevents future code from going back to the old patterns.

# GitHub Issue Comment Guidelines

## Opening Pattern

Always start with a personal greeting using the user's GitHub handle:

- "Hey @username, thank you for the issue"
- "Hey everyone, thanks for the notice!"
- "Hey all, thanks for the issue!"

## Core Elements

### 1. Acknowledgment

- Start by acknowledging their issue/contribution
- Express empathy for problems: "sorry to hear this!", "sorry to hear your shortcut was lost!"
- Apologize for delays: "I apologize for the delayed response"

### 2. Good News Delivery

When announcing features or fixes:

- "good news!" or "Good news!"
- Add celebration emoji sparingly: "ðŸŽ‰"
- Credit contributors: "Thank you for the inspiration" or "Thank you and @user1 and @user2 for the inspiration"

### 3. Debugging Offers

For complex issues, offer direct help:

- "If you have time, I would love to hop on a call with you, and we can debug this together"
- "Let's hop on a call sometime in the coming days, and I'll debug it with you"
- Always include cal.com link: "https://cal.com/epicenter/whispering"
- Add availability: "I'm free as early as tomorrow"

### 4. Discord Promotion

When appropriate, mention Discord:

- "PS: I've also recently created a Discord group, and I'd love for you to join! You can ping me directly for more features."
- Include link: "https://go.epicenter.so/discord"

### 5. Follow-up Questions

Ask clarifying questions to understand the issue better:

- "To clarify, could you confirm that this issue persists even with the latest v7.1.0 installer?"
- "Did you ever get a popup to grant permission to access recording devices?"
- "Does this happen when you make recordings for more than 4 seconds?"

### 6. Closing

End with gratitude:

- "Thank you!"
- "Thanks again!"
- "Thank you again for your help and will be taking a look!"
- "My pleasure!" (when thanked)

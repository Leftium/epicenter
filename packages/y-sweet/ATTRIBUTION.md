# Attribution

This package is a fork of [@y-sweet/client](https://github.com/jamsocket/y-sweet)
(v0.9.1) by [Jamsocket](https://jamsocket.com/) / Drifting in Space Corp.

## Why this fork exists

Y-Sweet is an excellent Yjs sync client with features like encrypted offline
persistence, heartbeat monitoring, and automatic reconnection. After the
maintainer confirmed Y-Sweet is entering maintenance mode and the hosted
Jamsocket service is shutting down, we forked the client to continue iterating
on it as part of the Epicenter project.

We are grateful for the engineering work that went into Y-Sweet and want to
ensure this code continues to live on and evolve.

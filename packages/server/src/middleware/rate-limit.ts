/**
 * `rateLimit`: a fixed-window burn-rate cap for the inference policies seam.
 *
 * The OpenAI-compatible gateway (`mountInferenceApp`) proxies to a provider with
 * the deployment's HOUSE key, so every accepted request spends the operator's
 * money. `policies` is where a deployment gates that spend: the cloud passes its
 * Autumn credit charge, and a self-hosted instance can pass this to cap the burn
 * rate so a leaked or overused bearer cannot run the provider bill up unbounded.
 * It is the in-process backstop; the real ceiling is the hard spend limit the
 * operator sets on the provider key itself (see apps/self-host/README.md).
 *
 * One counter per owner partition, keyed off `c.var.ownerId` (set by the upstream
 * `requireOwnership` that every `policies` middleware runs after). On the
 * single-partition instance that is one global bucket; on a per-user deployment it
 * is per user, with no config change, because the ownership rule already encodes
 * the right granularity.
 *
 * The window lives in process memory: EXACT on the blessed single-node Bun
 * instance, and per-isolate (so approximate) on Cloudflare, which is the same
 * single-node accuracy tradeoff the instance accepts everywhere. It is sized for
 * the small trusted group the instance targets, not multi-tenant scale; durable,
 * shared limiting at scale is Cloud's concern (Autumn), not this primitive.
 *
 * A denied request answers `429` in the gateway's OpenAI error envelope
 * (`{ error: { message, code } }`) with a `Retry-After` header, so the inference
 * client's reducer keeps its branchable `error.code`.

/**
 * Structured error variant for a failed call to the billing provider.
 *
 * A `BillingError` means one thing: the call to our billing provider
 * (Autumn) failed, so we fail closed. It is deliberately opaque, a
 * single human-readable `message`. It carries neither the provider's
 * HTTP status nor Autumn's machine `code`, because there is no
 * user-actionable sub-state to branch on: whether Autumn returned a 502,
 * a 503, or a socket timeout, the only honest response is "billing is
 * temporarily unavailable, try again," and surfacing the vendor's code
 * would leak provider internals into the wire format.
 *
 * The actionable billing states (out of credits, model needs a paid
 * plan, storage quota exceeded) are NOT `BillingError`. They are typed
 * domain variants on the surface that raises them
 * (`AiChatError.InsufficientCredits`, `AiChatError.ModelRequiresPaidPlan`,
 * `AssetError.StorageLimitExceeded`), each with its own HTTP status. The
 * dashboard/clients branch on those for conversion UX; a `BillingError`
 * is always rendered as a single opaque message.
 *
 * The `ProviderRequestFailed` name avoids leaking the vendor: a future
 * swap to direct Stripe integration would not force a client rename.
 *
 * The message is a fixed, user-facing string owned here, not the provider's
 * wording: a card processor's "Request failed with status 500" or a transport
 * library's "Unable to make request" is noise to a user and leaks the vendor.
 * The full original error (status, body, class) is recorded for operators at
 * the adapter boundary ({@link file://./autumn.ts} `mapAutumnError`), so the
 * wire stays thin while the log stays fat.
 *
 * The wire contract is the fixed **503** status, not the body shape. A provider
 * failure is the only thing the billing surface answers with 503 (every domain
 * error carries its own status; non-provider throws become 500), so the
 * dashboard rebuilds this canonical error from the 503 alone and never has to
 * validate the serialized body. See `readResponse` in
 * {@link file://../../ui/src/lib/billing/api.ts}.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * // Server: the billing-routes onError boundary maps any thrown provider
 * // failure through the adapter; non-provider throws rethrow to a 500.
 * import { isProviderError, mapAutumnError } from './autumn.js';
 *
 * billingRoutes.onError((err, c) => {
 *   if (!isProviderError(err)) throw err;
 *   return c.json(mapAutumnError(err), 503);
 * });
 *
 * // Client: type-only narrowing (from apps/api/ui via $api alias)
 * import type { BillingError } from '$api/billing/errors';
 * function handle(error: BillingError) {
 *   // one opaque message; render it, optionally offer retry
 *   showBillingUnavailable(error.message);
 * }
 * ```

/**
 * Discriminated union of all billing error payloads.
 *

 * statements with `default: error satisfies never`.

/**
 * # YKeyValueLww - Last-Write-Wins Key-Value Store for Yjs
 *
 * A timestamp-based variant of YKeyValue that uses last-write-wins (LWW) conflict
 * resolution instead of positional ordering.
 *
 * **See also**: `y-keyvalue.ts` for the simpler positional (rightmost-wins) version.
 *
 * ## When to Use This vs YKeyValue
 *
 * | Scenario | Use `YKeyValue` | Use `YKeyValueLww` |
 * |----------|-----------------|-------------------|
 * | Real-time collab | Yes | Either |
 * | Offline-first, multi-device | No | Yes |
 * | Clock sync unreliable | Yes | No |
 * | Need "latest edit wins" | No | Yes |
 *
 * ## How It Works
 *
 * Each entry stores a timestamp alongside the key and value:
 *
 * ```
 * { key: 'user-1', val: { name: 'Alice' }, ts: 1706200000000 }
 * ```
 *
 * When conflicts occur (two clients set the same key while offline), the entry
 * with the **higher timestamp wins**. This gives intuitive "last write wins"
 * semantics.
 *
 * ```
 * Client A (2:00pm): { key: 'x', val: 'A', ts: 1706200400000 }
 * Client B (3:00pm): { key: 'x', val: 'B', ts: 1706204000000 }
 *
 * After sync: B wins (higher timestamp), regardless of sync order
 * ```
 *
 * ## Timestamp Generation
 *
 * Uses a monotonic clock that guarantees:
 * - Local writes always have increasing timestamps (no same-millisecond collisions)
 * - Clock regression is handled (ignores backward jumps)
 * - Cross-device convergence by adopting higher timestamps from synced entries
 *
 * ```typescript
 * // Simplified logic:
 * const now = Date.now();
 * this.lastTimestamp = now > this.lastTimestamp ? now : this.lastTimestamp + 1;
 * return this.lastTimestamp;
 * ```
 *
 * Tracks the maximum timestamp from both local writes and remote synced entries.
 * Devices with slow clocks "catch up" after syncing, preventing their writes from
 * losing to stale timestamps.
 *
 * ## Tiebreaker
 *
 * When timestamps are equal (rare - requires synchronized clocks AND coincidental
 * timing), falls back to positional ordering (rightmost wins). This is deterministic
 * because Yjs's CRDT merge produces consistent ordering based on clientID.
 *
 * ## Limitations
 *
 * - Future clock dominance: If a device's clock is far in the future, its writes dominate
 *   indefinitely. All devices adopt the highest timestamp seen, so writes won't catch up
 *   until wall-clock reaches that point. Rare with NTP, but be aware in environments with
 *   unreliable time sync.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * import * as Y from 'yjs';
 * import { YKeyValueLww } from './y-keyvalue-lww';
 *
 * const doc = new Y.Doc();
 * const yarray = doc.getArray<{ key: string; val: any; ts: number }>('data');
 * const kv = new YKeyValueLww(yarray);
 *
 * kv.set('user1', { name: 'Alice' });  // ts auto-generated
 * kv.get('user1');  // { name: 'Alice' }
 * ```
 */

	 *                 │
	 *                 └───► pending.delete('foo')      ← Clears pending
	 *
	 *
	 * get('foo') is called:
	 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
	 *
	 *   get()
	 *     │
	 *     ├───► Check pending.get('foo')  ← If found, return it

	 *
	 * Tracks the highest timestamp seen from BOTH local writes and remote synced entries.
	 * This ensures:
	 * 1. **Same-millisecond writes on same device**: Always get unique, sequential timestamps

	 *    - Write at t=1000 (same ms!) → ts=1002 (incremented again)
	 *
	 * 2. **Clock regression**: If system clock goes backward (NTP adjustment), continue
	 *    incrementing from lastTimestamp instead of going backward
	 *
	 * 3. **Self-healing from clock skew**: After syncing with devices that have faster clocks,
	 *    adopt their higher timestamps so future local writes win conflicts
	 *    - Example: Device A's clock at 1000ms syncs entry from Device B with ts=5000ms
	 *    - Device A's lastTimestamp becomes 5000, next write uses 5001 (not 1001)

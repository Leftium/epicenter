# Migrate Y-Sweet to @epicenter/sync: Custom Provider + Server Protocol Extension

**Date**: 2026-02-14
**Status**: Implemented
**Author**: AI-assisted
**Related specs**: `20260213T120800-extract-epicenter-server-package.md`, `20260213T120800-cloud-sync-durable-objects.md`, `20260213T120813-encryption-at-rest-architecture.md`

## Overview

Replace the forked `@epicenter/y-sweet` client provider and the Y-Sweet server dependency with a clean `@epicenter/sync` provider backed by the `@epicenter/server` Elysia sync plugin. The provider is **rewritten from scratch** as a factory function with a supervisor loop — not a renamed class. The server gets `MESSAGE_SYNC_STATUS` (102) echo, server-side ping/pong keepalive, and room idle eviction. The result is a fully owned sync stack that follows this codebase's conventions.

## Motivation

### Current State

Two sync stacks running side-by-side:

```
CLIENT SIDE:
  @epicenter/y-sweet (forked from @y-sweet/client v0.9.1)
    → YSweetProvider with heartbeat, hasLocalChanges, reconnection
    → Connects to Y-Sweet server at /d/{docId}/ws

  y-sweet-persist-sync extension
    → Orchestrates provider + persistence (IndexedDB/filesystem)
    → directAuth() constructs Y-Sweet URL format

SERVER SIDE:
  @epicenter/server (packages/server/)
    → Elysia sync plugin at /workspaces/{id}/sync
    → Handles MESSAGE_SYNC (0), MESSAGE_AWARENESS (1), MESSAGE_QUERY_AWARENESS (3)
    → Does NOT handle MESSAGE_SYNC_STATUS (102)
```

This creates problems:

1. **Y-Sweet is dead.** Jamsocket's hosted service shuts down March 4, 2026. The open-source Rust binary is unmaintained in practice. We're carrying a fork of a dead project's client code.
2. **Two URL formats.** Y-Sweet uses `/d/{docId}/ws`. Our Elysia server uses `/workspaces/{id}/sync`. The `directAuth` helper constructs Y-Sweet URLs that don't work with our server.
3. **Missing heartbeat on our server.** The Elysia sync plugin doesn't handle `MESSAGE_SYNC_STATUS` (102), so `hasLocalChanges` never resolves and the 5-second dead connection detection doesn't work when pointing at our server.
4. **Confusing naming.** The package is called `y-sweet` but has nothing to do with Y-Sweet anymore — it's our own code. Extensions reference Y-Sweet in their names (`y-sweet-persist-sync`).

### Desired State

A single, owned sync stack with a clear name:

```
CLIENT SIDE:
  @epicenter/sync (renamed from @epicenter/y-sweet)
    → SyncProvider (renamed from YSweetProvider)
    → Connects to our Elysia server at /workspaces/{id}/sync
    → Heartbeat, hasLocalChanges, 5-state model, reconnection

  sync extension (renamed from y-sweet-persist-sync)
    → Same orchestration, new import paths

SERVER SIDE:
  @epicenter/server (packages/server/)
    → Elysia sync plugin handles 0, 1, 3, AND 102
    → MESSAGE_SYNC_STATUS echo enables hasLocalChanges + fast heartbeat
```

### The Killer Feature: MESSAGE_SYNC_STATUS

`MESSAGE_SYNC_STATUS` (tag 102) is application-layer TCP sequence numbers. It gives you three capabilities from one mechanism:

1. **`hasLocalChanges`** — binary flag for "Saving..." / "Saved" UI
2. **Heartbeat** — 2s probe + 3s timeout = 5s dead connection detection (vs y-websocket's 45s)
3. **Zero cost** — server just echoes bytes. Never parses the version number. Can't corrupt sync state.

Wire format:

```
[varuint: 102] [varuint: payload length] [varuint: localVersion]
```

Server implementation is ~5 lines:

```typescript
case MESSAGE_SYNC_STATUS: {
  // Echo the payload back — that's it.
  const payload = decoding.readVarUint8Array(decoder);
  ws.send(toBuffer(encodeMessageSyncStatus({ payload })));
  break;
}
```

Tag 102 is safely outside the standard Yjs protocol range (0–3). Any y-websocket client/server that doesn't understand it simply ignores it — no breakage.

### Auth: Three-Mode System (Already Designed)

The auth system is fully designed in `20260213T120800-extract-epicenter-server-package.md` Phase 2. The provider needs to support all three modes:

| Mode                 | Server Config                | Client Config                           | Use Case                         |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **1: Open**          | `auth: undefined`            | `url` only                              | localhost, Tailscale, LAN        |
| **2: Shared Secret** | `auth: { secret: '...' }`    | `url` + `token: '...'`                  | Self-hosted, exposed to internet |
| **3: External JWT**  | `auth: { jwtSecret: '...' }` | `url` + `getToken: async (id) => '...'` | Epicenter Cloud, power users     |

The provider's auth callback (`getToken`) already handles token refresh on reconnect — this is the Y-Sweet `ensureClientToken` pattern, renamed.

### Naming Conventions

The current fork has Y-Sweet naming throughout:

| Current Name              | New Name                | Rationale                                                          |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `@epicenter/y-sweet`      | `@epicenter/sync`       | We own it. It's not Y-Sweet.                                       |
| `YSweetProvider`          | `SyncProvider`          | Describes what it does, not its origin                             |
| `YSweetProviderParams`    | `SyncProviderConfig`    | Convention: `Config` suffix                                        |
| `YSweetStatus`            | `SyncStatus`            |                                                                    |
| `ClientToken`             | Removed                 | Replaced by `SyncProviderConfig.url` + optional `token`/`getToken` |
| `createYjsProvider`       | `createSyncProvider`    |                                                                    |
| `y-sweet-persist-sync`    | `sync` (extension name) | The extension is just called "sync"                                |
| `ySweetPersistSync`       | `createSyncExtension`   | Follows `create*` factory pattern                                  |
| `YSweetPersistSyncConfig` | `SyncExtensionConfig`   |                                                                    |
| `directAuth(url)`         | Removed                 | URL is just passed directly                                        |

## Design Decisions

| Decision                            | Choice                                                  | Rationale                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Rewrite provider, don't rename      | Factory function with supervisor loop                   | The forked class has 7 interacting subsystems, 4 entry points to `connect()`, event handlers making reconnection decisions, and `status` serving as both observable state and control flow. A rename ships a known-messy design under our brand. See `20260213T000000-fix-disconnect-reconnect-race.md` Part 2 for the full structural critique. |
| Factory function, not class         | `createSyncProvider()` returns object                   | Matches codebase conventions (`createSyncPlugin`, `createSleeper`, `createIndexLogger`). Closure-based state eliminates `this` binding. Method shorthand preserves JSDoc.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Supervisor loop architecture        | One loop decides, everything else reports               | The Y-Sweet provider has `websocketClose`, `websocketError`, `setConnectionTimeout`, AND the connect loop all making reconnection decisions. The supervisor pattern centralizes this: event handlers resolve a promise, the loop decides what to do.                                                                                             |
| Separate `desired` from `status`    | `desired: 'online' \| 'offline'` + `status: SyncStatus` | Currently `status` is both UI-observable state AND connect loop control flow. Splitting them means `disconnect()` sets `desired = 'offline'` and the loop exits cleanly — no race conditions.                                                                                                                                                    |
| Server-side ping/pong               | 30s interval in Elysia sync plugin                      | Client heartbeat (102) detects dead connections from the client side. But if the client dies (laptop lid closed), the server has no way to know. Server ping/pong catches dead TCP connections that the client can't report. y-websocket server does this; our server doesn't.                                                                   |
| Room idle eviction                  | Destroy rooms after 60s with no connections             | The current server keeps rooms in memory forever. A long-running server with many workspaces will leak memory. `createRoom()` already has `destroy()` in the server spec.                                                                                                                                                                        |
| Add MESSAGE_SYNC_STATUS to server   | Echo handler in Elysia sync plugin                      | ~5 lines. Unlocks `hasLocalChanges` + fast heartbeat for all clients.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Rename package to `@epicenter/sync` | Clean break                                             | Y-Sweet name is confusing.

// Mode 1: localhost, no auth
createSyncExtension({
	url: 'ws://localhost:3913/workspaces/{id}/sync',
	persistence: indexeddbPersistence,
});

// Mode 2: self-hosted with shared secret
createSyncExtension({
	url: 'ws://my-server:3913/workspaces/{id}/sync',
	token: 'my-shared-secret',
	persistence: indexeddbPersistence,
});

// Mode 3: cloud with dynamic token
createSyncExtension({
	url: 'wss://sync.epicenter.so/workspaces/{id}/sync',
	getToken: async (workspaceId) => {
		const res = await fetch('/api/sync/token', {
			method: 'POST',
			credentials: 'include',
			body: JSON.stringify({ workspaceId }),
		});
		return (await res.json()).token;
	},
	persistence: indexeddbPersistence,
});
```

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Server Hardening

Three changes to the Elysia sync plugin. All are independent and can be done in parallel.

#### 1A: MESSAGE_SYNC_STATUS Echo

Unlocks `hasLocalChanges` + fast heartbeat for all connected providers.

- [x] **1A.1** Add `SYNC_STATUS: 102` to `MESSAGE_TYPE` constant in `packages/server/src/sync/protocol.ts` with JSDoc noting it's an extension beyond the standard y-websocket protocol
- [x] **1A.2** Add `encodeMessageSyncStatus({ payload })` encoder function to protocol.ts
- [x] **1A.3** Add echo handler in `packages/server/src/sync/index.ts` — receive type 102, echo the raw payload back as type 102
- [x] **1A.4** Add protocol test: encode → decode roundtrip for MESSAGE_SYNC_STATUS
- [x] **1A.5** Verify existing protocol tests still pass

#### 1B: Server-Side Ping/Pong Keepalive

Detects dead clients (laptop lid closed, browser killed) that the client-side heartbeat can't catch.

- [x] **1B.1** Add 30-second `setInterval` per connection in the `open()` handler that calls `ws.raw.ping()` (Bun's ServerWebSocket supports this)
- [x] **1B.2** Track `pongReceived` boolean per connection (in `connectionState` WeakMap). Set `true` on pong, `false` before each ping.
- [x] **1B.3** If `pongReceived === false` when next ping fires, close the connection — server considers client dead
- [x] **1B.4** Clean up the interval in the `close()` handler
- [x] **1B.5** Test: verify connections are cleaned up when client stops responding

#### 1C: Room Idle Eviction

Prevents memory leaks on long-running servers with many workspaces.

- [x] **1C.1** When the last connection leaves a room, start a 60-second eviction timer instead of immediately deleting the room
- [x] **1C.2** If a new connection joins before the timer fires, cancel the timer
- [x] **1C.3** When the timer fires, destroy the awareness instance and delete the room from the map
- [x] **1C.4** Log room eviction events for observability

### Phase 2: Rewrite Provider as Factory Function

This is the core of the migration. Replace the Y-Sweet class with a clean factory function using the supervisor loop architecture from `20260213T000000-fix-disconnect-reconnect-race.md`.

#### Why Rewrite, Not Rename

The current `YSweetProvider` class has structural problems documented in the race condition spec:

- **7 subsystems** competing through 11 pieces of shared mutable state
- **4 call sites** all calling `connect()` — constructor, websocketClose, websocketError, heartbeat timeout
- **Event handlers make decisions** — `websocketClose` sets `STATUS_ERROR` and calls `connect()` instead of just reporting
- **Status is both state and control flow** — `setStatus(ERROR)` implicitly keeps the connect loop running
- **No single owner** of "should we be connected?" — 6 different mechanisms, 4 call sites, 2 guard strategies

A rename ships all of this under our brand. A rewrite fixes it.

#### What Changes From Y-Sweet, What Stays

#### Implementation Steps

- [x] **2.1** Create `packages/sync/` directory with `package.json` (`@epicenter/sync`), `tsconfig.json`
- [x] **2.2** Copy `sleeper.ts` verbatim — it's already a clean factory function
- [x] **2.3** Write `types.ts` with `SyncProviderConfig`, `SyncStatus`, `SyncProvider` type
- [x] **2.4** Write `provider.ts` — the `createSyncProvider()` factory function:
  - Closure state: `desired`, `status`, `runId`, `localVersion`, `ackedVersion`, `websocket`, `heartbeatHandle`, `connectionTimeoutHandle`, `reconnectSleeper`, `statusListeners`, `localChangesListeners`
  - Supervisor loop: `runLoop(myRunId)` — single owner of status transitions and reconnection
  - Token handling: if `config.getToken`, call it on each connection attempt; if `config.token`, use static; if neither, no auth
  - Token transport: `Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header (primary), `?token=` query param (fallback)
  - Heartbeat: same timing (2s idle → probe, 3s timeout → close socket)
  - `hasLocalChanges`: same `localVersion` / `ackedVersion` mechanism
  - Event handlers: `onopen` → resolve connect promise; `onclose`/`onerror` → resolve socketClosed promise; `onmessage` → dispatch by message type
  - Browser events: `online` wakes sleeper, `offline` triggers immediate probe
  - `destroy()`: disconnect, remove doc/awareness listeners, remove window listeners
- [x] **2.5** Write `index.ts` — public exports
- [x] **2.6** Write tests for the new provider:
  - Connect/disconnect lifecycle
  - Reconnection after socket close
  - `hasLocalChanges` toggles on sync status echo
  - `desired` / `status` separation (disconnect during connect doesn't race)
  - Token refresh after N retries
  - `destroy()` cleans up all listeners
- [x] **2.7** Delete `packages/y-sweet/` entirely — the old code is gone
- [x] **2.8** Update all imports: `@epicenter/y-sweet` → `@epicenter/sync`
- [x] **2.9** Update `bun.lock` / workspace references

### Phase 3: Rename Extension + Simplify Auth

Rename the extension files and update the config to use the new provider API.

- [x] **3.1** Rename `y-sweet-persist-sync.ts` → `sync.ts`
- [x] **3.2** Rename `y-sweet-persist-sync.test.ts` → `sync.test.ts`
- [x] **3.3** Rename `y-sweet-persist-sync/` → `sync/` (web.ts, desktop.ts)
- [x] **3.4** Rename `ySweetPersistSync` → `createSyncExtension`
- [x] **3.5** Rename `YSweetPersistSyncConfig` → `SyncExtensionConfig`
- [x] **3.6** Simplify config:
  ```typescript
  type SyncExtensionConfig = {
  	/** WebSocket URL. Use {id} placeholder for workspace ID. */
  	url: string | ((workspaceId: string) => string);
  	/** Static token (Mode 2). */
  	token?: string;
  	/** Dynamic token fetcher (Mode 3). */
  	getToken?: (workspaceId: string) => Promise<string>;
  	/** Persistence factory (REQUIRED). */
  	persistence: (context: { ydoc: Y.Doc }) => Lifecycle;
  };
  ```
- [x] **3.7** Remove `directAuth()` helper — URL is passed directly
- [x] **3.8** Remove `ClientToken` type and `YSweetClientToken` re-export
- [x] **3.9** Update `package.json` exports: `./extensions/y-sweet-persist-sync` → `./extensions/sync`
- [x] **3.10** Update consumer imports (tab-manager, epicenter app)
- [x] **3.11** Update extension tests for new config shape

### Phase 4: Delete Dead Code

- [x] **4.1** Delete `apps/epicenter/src/lib/yjs/y-sweet-connection.ts`
- [x] **4.2** Remove any remaining Y-Sweet URL format references (`/d/{docId}/ws`)
- [x] **4.3** Remove `@y-sweet/client` and `@y-sweet/sdk` from any remaining dependency lists
- [x] **4.4** Grep for `y-sweet`, `ysweet`, `YSweet` across the codebase — nothing outside specs/ and docs/

### Phase 5: Verification

- [x] **5.1** `bun test` passes in `packages/sync/` (15 tests pass)
- [x] **5.2** `bun test` passes in `packages/epicenter/` (sync extension: 5 tests pass)
- [x] **5.3** `bun test` passes in `packages/server/` (56 tests pass)
- [x] **5.4** `bun typecheck` passes across packages/sync/ and packages/server/ (no new errors)
- [ ] **5.5** Manual test: start Elysia server, connect provider, verify `hasLocalChanges` toggles correctly

## Edge Cases

### MESSAGE_SYNC_STATUS with Standard y-websocket Clients

If a y-websocket client connects to our server and receives a type 102 message, it ignores it (unknown tags are silently skipped in all Yjs implementations). No breakage.

### Provider Connected to Non-Echo Server

If `createSyncProvider` connects to a server that doesn't echo 102 (e.g., a standard y-websocket server), the heartbeat messages are sent but ignored. The provider must track whether it has ever received a 102 response on the current connection. If it hasn't, it doesn't arm the 3-second reconnect timeout — preventing false-positive disconnects. This is the same backward-compatibility guard Y-Sweet uses.

### Token Expiry During Active Session

JWT is validated only at WebSocket upgrade time. Once connected, the session is trusted for the duration of that connection. On reconnect (after socket close), `getToken()` is called again to fetch a fresh token. No mid-session revalidation needed.

### Concurrent connect() Calls

The supervisor loop must be idempotent. If `connect()` is called while a loop is already running, it's a no-op. Implementation: store the running loop's promise; if non-null, don't start another.

### disconnect() During Backoff Sleep

`disconnect()` sets `desired = 'offline'` and bumps `runId`. The sleeping loop wakes (via `sleeper.wake()`), checks `runId`, sees it changed, exits. No race because the loop checks `runId` after every await.

### Server Ping Timeout vs Client Heartbeat

Both mechanisms run independently:

- **Client heartbeat (102)**: Client detects dead server within 5 seconds
- **Server ping/pong**: Server detects dead client within 60 seconds (30s interval × 2 pings)

They don't interfere because they operate at different protocol layers (application vs WebSocket).

### Room Eviction Race

A connection joins room "X", then disconnects. Eviction timer starts (60s). A new connection joins "X" at 59s. The timer must be cancelled. Implementation: store the timer handle in the room state; clear it on new connection join.

## Open Questions

1. **Should `MESSAGE_SYNC_STATUS` be added to `MESSAGE_TYPE` in protocol.ts or kept as a separate constant?**
   - It's an extension beyond the standard y-websocket protocol.
   - **Recommendation**: Add it to `MESSAGE_TYPE` as `SYNC_STATUS: 102` with a JSDoc comment. We own both sides, and keeping protocol constants in one place is cleaner.

2. **Should the provider expose the raw WebSocket for testing?**
   - Unit tests need to simulate server responses (send fake MESSAGE_SYNC_STATUS, close the socket, etc.).
   - **Recommendation**: Accept a `WebSocketPolyfill` in config (same as Y-Sweet did). Tests can pass a mock WebSocket constructor.

3. **Should the provider support connecting to multiple servers simultaneously?**
   - The current architecture supports this via multiple `createSyncExtension` calls on the same workspace.
   - **Recommendation**: Keep single-server per provider. Multi-server is a workspace-level concern.

4. **Should room eviction also persist the Y.Doc state to disk before destroying?**
   - Currently the server is stateless (no server-side persistence). If a room is evicted and a client reconnects, the client syncs its full state vector.
   - **Recommendation**: No server-side persistence for now. Client-side persistence (IndexedDB/filesystem) is the source of truth. Defer server persistence to a future spec if needed.

5. **Should `@epicenter/sync` also export a Rust-compatible protocol definition?**
   - If the Elysia server eventually gets a Rust companion for performance-critical paths.
   - **Recommendation**: TypeScript only for now. It's one constant (`102`). Manual sync is fine.

## Success Criteria

- [x] `@epicenter/y-sweet` package no longer exists — replaced by `@epicenter/sync`
- [x] `createSyncProvider()` is a factory function, not a class — closure-based state, supervisor loop, typed events
- [x] Server echoes MESSAGE_SYNC_STATUS (102) — `hasLocalChanges` works end-to-end
- [x] Server has ping/pong keepalive — dead clients detected within 60s
- [x] Server evicts idle rooms — no memory leaks on long-running servers
- [x] Provider connects to `@epicenter/server` Elysia sync endpoint (not Y-Sweet URLs)
- [x] Provider supports three auth modes: no auth, static token, dynamic getToken
- [x] Dead connection detected within 5 seconds from client side (heartbeat)
- [x] All tests pass in packages/sync, packages/epicenter, packages/server
- [x] Zero references to `y-sweet` outside specs/ and docs/ (historical references OK)
- [x] Tab manager and Epicenter app updated to use new import paths

/**
 * Reactive skill loader for Opensidian's two-layer prompt architecture.
 *
 * Opensidian assembles skills from two separate sources because they solve
 * different problems:
 *
 * 1. **Global skills** come from `skillsWorkspace`, the shared
 *    `@epicenter/skills` workspace persisted in its own IndexedDB database.
 *    These are ecosystem-wide conventions imported through Epicenter's skills
 *    tooling and shared across apps.
 * 2. **Vault skills** come from `/skills/*.md` inside the user's current vault.
 *    These are local markdown files that travel with the vault itself, making
 *    them ideal for project-specific instructions, notes, and overrides.
 *
 * When the system prompt is composed, the global layer provides the stable,
 * cross-app baseline—things like house style, workflow rules, and reusable
 * patterns. The vault layer adds local context that belongs to this specific
 * vault. Keeping both layers separate avoids conflating "shared Epicenter
 * conventions" with "instructions that should live next to the user's notes."
 *
 * Error handling is intentionally forgiving. A missing or empty global skills
 * workspace means there simply are no imported global skills yet, so loading
 * falls back to an empty list. A missing `/skills` directory is also normal for
 * a brand-new vault, so that case is treated as "no vault skills" rather than a
 * user-facing failure.
 *
 * @example
 * ```typescript
 * await skillState.loadAllSkills();
 *
 * const globalLayer = skillState.globalSkills;
 * const vaultLayer = skillState.vaultSkills;
 * ```

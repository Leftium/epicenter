/**
 * `createDocumentFactory` — a minimal refcounted cache for Y.Doc bundles.
 *
 * The user owns construction and disposal. The cache owns identity, refcount,
 * and the `gcTime` grace period between last-dispose and actual teardown.
 * Readiness **and** disposal-barriers are attachment-level conventions, not
 * framework concerns — bundles expose them (or don't) as they see fit, and
 * consumers await whichever gate fits at the call site.
 *
 * ```text
 *  builder (user)                     cache (this module)
 *  ─────────────────                  ───────────────────
 *  new Y.Doc + providers              keyed by id, verified by ydoc.guid
 *  owns readiness/teardown promises   refcounts open/dispose
 *  implements [Symbol.dispose] (sync) arms gcTime timer on last dispose
 * ```
 *
 * ## Three usage levels
 *
 * ### Level 0 — plain builder, no cache
 *
 * ```ts
 * const doc = buildDoc('x');
 * doc.ydoc.transact(() => ..., ORIGIN);
 * doc[Symbol.dispose]();
 * ```
 *
 * ### Level 1 — scope-bound with TS 5.2 `using`
 *
 * ```ts
 * {
 *   using doc = buildDoc('x');
 *   await doc.whenReady;  // if the builder exposes one by convention
 *   doc.ydoc.transact(() => ..., ORIGIN);
 * } // [Symbol.dispose] fires on block exit
 * ```
 *
 * ### Level 2 — shared + lifecycle via `createDocumentFactory`
 *
 * ```ts
 * const docs = createDocumentFactory(buildDoc, { gcTime: 30_000 });
 *
 * // Imperative caller that needs loaded data — open, then await the
 * // builder-conventional readiness gate at the call site.
 * using h = docs.open('abc');
 * await h.whenReady;                   // builder convention, not framework
 * h.ydoc.transact(() => ..., ORIGIN);
 *
 * // Reactive caller that wants the handle immediately: same `open()`, no
 * // await. Subscribe to reactive state now; await readiness in a `$effect`
 * // if the UI needs it.
 * using h = docs.open('abc');          // openCount++
 * // [Symbol.dispose] fires on block exit — openCount--
 * // refcount→0 arms the gcTime timer; a fresh open() cancels it
 *
 * // Rare teardown barrier: opt into a specific attachment's field.
 * docs.close('abc');
 * await h.idb.whenDisposed;            // attachment-level, if you need it
 * ```
 *
 * ## Builder contract
 *
 * The builder returns a bundle typed
 * `T extends { ydoc: Y.Doc } & Disposable` — i.e., any object with a
 * `ydoc: Y.Doc` and a synchronous `[Symbol.dispose]()`. Anything else
 * (readiness promises, attachment handles, materializer interfaces) is at
 * the builder's discretion and flows through the handle verbatim:
 *
 * ```ts
 * function buildDoc(id: string) {
 *   const ydoc = new Y.Doc({ guid: id });
 *   const idb  = attachIndexedDb(ydoc);
 *   const sync = attachSync(ydoc, { url, waitFor: idb.whenLoaded });
 *
 *   return {
 *     ydoc,
 *     body: attachRichText(ydoc),
 *     // `whenReady` is a builder convention that answers a single question:
 *     // "can I render the UI yet?" For local-first apps that means local
 *     // state is in memory — i.e. `idb.whenLoaded`. Sync's `whenConnected`
 *     // is intentionally NOT included; waiting on the network would block
 *     // offline users and produce a blank editor over slow connections.
 *     // Consumers that truly need remote state (CLI export, snapshot tools)
 *     // await `sync.whenConnected` explicitly at the call site.
 *     whenReady: idb.whenLoaded,
 *     [Symbol.dispose]() { ydoc.destroy(); },
 *   };
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * ## Attachment-level `when*` barriers
 *
 * Attachments expose descriptive `when*` promises that consumers can await
 * directly. The framework does not aggregate or orchestrate these — each
 * consumer awaits whichever barrier fits the call site.
 *
 * ```text
 *  idb.whenLoaded      — local storage replayed into the Y.Doc
 *  sync.whenConnected  — WebSocket up + first remote exchange done
 *  idb.whenDisposed    — this provider's teardown settled
 *  sync.whenDisposed   — ditto, per provider
 * ```
 *
 * Builders may aggregate these into a bundle-level `whenReady` as a
 * convention (see Builder contract above). `whenReady` answers exactly
 * one question for consumers: **"can I render the UI yet?"** For editors
 * and other local-first views that answer is `idb.whenLoaded` — render as
 * soon as the user's draft is in memory, regardless of network state.
 * The name is load-bearing for grep-ability and review, but it's a
 * convention — not a contract the framework enforces. Consumers typically
 * consume it via Svelte's `{#await}` block (template-level) rather than
 * `$effect`-plus-flag plumbing.
 *
 * ## Provider teardown
 *
 * `[Symbol.dispose]()` is **synchronous** — it calls `ydoc.destroy()` and
 * returns. Attachments like `attachIndexedDb` and `attachSync` self-wire
 * via `ydoc.on('destroy')` internally, and their real async cleanup (IDB
 * `db.close()`, WebSocket onclose, etc.) runs in the background after
 * dispose returns. Idempotency is free: `Y.Doc` sets `isDestroyed` on first
 * destroy and noops on subsequent calls; attachments use a `disposed` flag.
 *
 * `factory.close(id)` and `factory.closeAll()` trigger this cascade and
 * return `void` — they do **not** wait for async cleanup to settle. Callers
 * that need a real teardown barrier (tests that close-then-reopen the same
 * id, CLI flows that exit the process) opt in at the specific call site
 * by awaiting an attachment-level field:
 *
 * ```ts
 * docs.close(id);
 * await h.idb.whenDisposed;     // explicit, not magic
 * ```
 *
 * ## Cache semantics
 *
 * - **Identity**: keyed by `id`; `ydoc.guid` is recorded on first construction
 *   and verified on every subsequent one (catches nondeterministic builders).
 * - **Refcount**: each `open()` mints a fresh disposable handle and
 *   increments. `handle.dispose()` is idempotent per-handle. Last dispose
 *   across all handles for an id arms the gcTime timer.
 * - **`gcTime: 0`** — synchronous teardown on refcount→0, no timer.
 * - **`gcTime: Infinity`** (default) — never evict automatically; only
 *   `close(id)` or `closeAll()` can force teardown.
 * - **Finite `gcTime`** — arm a timer on refcount→0; a fresh `open()` during
 *   the grace window cancels the pending teardown.
 *
 * Why `Infinity` is the default: a Y.Doc bundle isn't a query result — it's a
 * handle to live, synced state. Re-opening costs a full IDB reload + websocket
 * reconnect + resync handshake, and during the gap remote updates are missed.
 * Explicit `close(id)` is the right teardown signal for docs; idle timeout is
 * opt-in for high-churn cases.
 *
 * ## Force close semantics
 *
 * `close(id)` and `closeAll()` tear down the bundle **even if handles are
 * still outstanding**. Those outstanding handles become unusable — reads
 * through the prototype chain still reach the bundle, but operations like
 * `h.ydoc.transact(...)` will hit Y.Doc's "destroyed doc" behavior. Force
 * close is for caller-initiated teardown (logout, workspace unmount, app
 * shutdown); in steady-state use, let refcount→0 drive disposal instead.

/**
 * Recording intermediate representation.

 * This type represents the unified interface for recordings across the application.
 * It is NOT the storage format - different storage implementations use different formats:
 *
 * - Desktop: Stores metadata in markdown files (.md) and audio in separate files (.webm, .mp3)
 * - Web: Stores in IndexedDB with serialized audio (see RecordingStoredInIndexedDB)
 *
 * Both implementations read their storage format and convert it to this intermediate
 * representation for use in the UI layer.
 *
 * Audio access: Audio data is NOT stored in this intermediate representation. Instead, use:
 * - `db.recordings.getAudioBlob(id)` to fetch audio as a Blob
 * - `db.recordings.ensureAudioPlaybackUrl(id)` to get a playback URL
 * - `db.recordings.revokeAudioUrl(id)` to clean up cached URLs

# Adversarial review

Independently reconstruct the affected system, then hunt for the decision that
would make a whole family of code or planned work unnecessary. Ask what stronger
invariant, different owner, or smaller promise would let the system collapse.
Passing tests and individually defensible abstractions do not settle whether
the model deserves to survive.

Hold the user's desired outcome steady while challenging the implementation,
remaining plan, and inherited requirements. Reconstruct from actual callers so
the implementer's explanation does not become the reviewer's frame. Even when
no bugs are apparent, construct a concrete smaller alternative to stress-test
the current design. Zoom out when local cleanup leaves the machinery intact.

Success is a better-supported next decision. Count complexity introduced as
well as removed, including work transferred to the user. Keeping the design is
valid after testing the alternative; neither forced disagreement nor deletion
at any cost is the job.

## Establish independence

If you are already the delegated reviewer, perform the review yourself and
launch no child agents. The following setup belongs to the coordinating agent.

The coordinating agent appoints one fresh read-only `gpt-6-astra` subagent with
`fork_turns: "none"` and `reasoning_effort: "high"`, and one read-only Claude
Opus reviewer through [consult-claude](../consult-claude/SKILL.md). Explicit
user choices override this default. Ordinary final checks remain local under
post-implementation-review.

Give both reviewers the same evidence and complementary starting questions.
Run them in parallel when possible, and withhold each reviewer's findings from
the other until both initial verdicts arrive. Assign the starting questions
without assuming either model is better at simplification or guarantee tracing.
If either reviewer is unavailable, report that limitation and continue with the
available review. If neither is available, perform the pass locally and state
that it was not independent.

Reviewer one starts with:

> Where is the strongest simplification? What stronger invariant, different owner,
> or smaller promise would let us delete a family of code or planned work? Name
> the deletion prize and its cost.

Reviewer two starts with:

> What would the simpler design have to preserve to be worth adopting? Trace
> concrete callers and lifecycle sequences to find the guarantees the current
> complexity provides. Which guarantees matter to the user, and which are
> inherited assumptions? Show where simplification would break a necessary
> guarantee or move the burden onto someone else.

These are starting questions, not assigned conclusions or separate file lanes.
Reviewer two examines possible simplifications independently, without waiting
for reviewer one's proposal. Both can discover a better design or conclude that
the current boundaries earn their place.

When reviewing a design before implementation, first give each reviewer the
desired outcome, explicit requirements, actual callers, and existing system,
without the implementer's proposed design or rationale. Ask each to sketch the
simplest viable design and name what it deletes. Preserve their independent
initial answers. Then provide the full proposal and reasoning to each reviewer
for a challenge against those answers. This ordering tests whether the proposal
anchored the search. For implemented work, the current checkout may already
expose the proposal; do not claim that the first pass was blind. Start from the
outcome and task-start baseline when available, then inspect the cumulative diff.

Give each reviewer raw artifacts, concrete proposals, engineering reasoning, and
open questions in the full-proposal pass. Distinguish facts, hypotheses,
preferences, and accepted constraints; the implementer's reasoning is
contestable evidence, not the answer:

- The accepted outcome, explicit constraints, and decision to be examined.
- The plan and remaining work, including newly discovered facts.
- For implementation, the task-start baseline and cumulative diff, including
  task-owned uncommitted and untracked files. Distinguish unrelated work.
- Relevant entrypoints, consumers, tests, and verification results. A summary
  alone is not sufficient evidence.

Include actual and proposed code, representative callsites, and an ASCII diagram
when it clarifies the design. Ask what the reviewer would build from the desired
outcome and actual callers if the current abstraction did not exist. Both
reviewers apply this review method themselves without launching more reviewers.
Codex owns any requested experiments.

For a proposal without implementation, supply the proposal and any existing
system it would replace. Distinguish observed behavior from design assumptions;
name what a prototype or caller would need to establish.

Hold the reviewed surface stable until the available reviewers return. Use that
interval for verification preparation or an independent question outside the surface.
Do not begin work whose shape depends on the verdict.

Neither reviewer edits the live checkout.
Reviewers beyond this pair need distinct unresolved questions. A second fresh
pair may be worth the cost when the framing itself is consequential and the
initial pair may share the same assumption. Do not commission four reviewers
as a standing panel. For a narrower blind spot, one additional reviewer can
examine that frame after reading their findings:

> Are we simplifying the right thing? What assumption about the problem, system
> boundary, or desired outcome are both reviews taking for granted? Trace that
> assumption back to actual users and callers. Show whether changing it would
> make the proposed simplification unnecessary or reveal a larger deletion prize.

Name the suspected shared assumption before commissioning this review. Agreement
alone does not require another reviewer, and reviewer one already has permission
to find the larger simplification.

## Reconstruct before judging

Trace the affected design through its entrypoints, callers, owners, lifecycle,
and invariants. Include earlier implementation waves and relevant unchanged
consumers. Expand only far enough to establish the owner and consequences;
this is not a repository-wide audit.

List every file read as an ASCII tree before analysis. Mentally inline helpers,
wrappers, components, props, compartments, and file boundaries into their call
sites. Read the resulting behavior as if encountering it for the first time.

For implemented code, apply
[post-implementation-review](../post-implementation-review/SKILL.md)'s inspection
passes in review-only mode: first read, mental inlining, ownership, smells,
invariants, API shape, naming, and file organization. This supplies the code
inspection; it does not initiate another independent review.

## Find the deletion prize

Ask what the local complexity is compensating for. Would moving an invariant
to construction, giving one object the lifecycle, or removing a stale promise
make a family of adapters, flags, callbacks, checks, or future tasks disappear?
Challenge new abstractions as readily as inherited ones.

Make the prize concrete: name the methods, types, modules, states, tests, docs
branches, or planned work that becomes unnecessary. Explain the replacement
guarantee. Fewer files alone proves little if callers inherit the same work or
lose a useful boundary. Preserve tests for behavior that must survive.

A compact implementation can still implement a bloated model. Challenge the
promise that requires the machinery, including previously accepted architecture
and product assumptions. Bring consequential tradeoffs to the human even when
they go beyond the current implementation plan; the reviewer proposes them
without treating them as authorized changes.

Distinguish a guarantee the software enforces from an obligation the user must
fulfill. For a proposed obligation, name the steps, what happens if they are
missed, and which guarantee the product can no longer claim. Moving work to a
person may be an excellent bargain, but that work remains part of the cost.
When exploring lifecycle resets or user-owned operations that eliminate
coordination, read [references/deletion-prizes.md](references/deletion-prizes.md).

Use focused skills for deeper decisions, without copying their procedures:

- [Rethink's radical-options reference](../rethink/references/radical-options.md)
  when local fixes preserve a bad abstraction and the better design may sit one
  level above it.
- [asymmetric-wins](../asymmetric-wins/SKILL.md) when refusing a small promise
  could delete a disproportionate code family. Name who loses what.
- [rethink](../rethink/SKILL.md) when the finding
  changes ownership, lifecycle, public contracts, or package boundaries. Use
  its design reasoning here; execution belongs to the coordinating agent.

Recommend a [collapse-pass](../collapse-pass/SKILL.md) when the evidence calls
for sustained removal of unearned indirection. The reviewer identifies the
opportunity; it does not begin that skill's editing or commit loop.

Product changes remain proposals for user judgment. Explicit user constraints
bound execution; surface a conflicting opportunity as a tradeoff rather than
silently dropping required behavior or data guarantees.

## Return a decision

Lead with the recommended path, whether it changes the current design or keeps
it. Show the mechanism and why it wins. Name the deletion prize when there is
one: the machinery or planned work that would disappear, and the replacement
guarantee. Explain the cost as a concrete consequence, such as losing unsaved
work, and what complexity a mitigation would retain or introduce. When keeping
the design, show the strongest deletion prize considered and why its cost makes
retention worthwhile.

Give each serious alternative enough shape to judge on its own. A compact ASCII
diagram can expose ownership or lifecycle; a code block can show an API; bullets
or a small table can distinguish multiple options. Use bold text to expose a
recommendation or requirement warning when it helps scanning. Do not force a
fixed number of options or headings. If one path clearly wins, explain it and
include only alternatives that illuminate the decision. Label any option that
conflicts with an explicit user requirement as a proposed requirement change,
and include the strongest compliant path when one is viable.

State downsides, remaining uncertainty, and the next discriminating check where
they affect the judgment. Give the current best estimate instead of listing
unknowns without analysis. Codex owns checks it can perform; do not hand the
user homework. Ask the user only about a product choice that evidence cannot
settle. Keep precise design terms and make their consequences understandable.

Read [the example workflow](references/example-workflow.md) when calibrating
how independent findings become a recommendation the user can judge. It shows
both a proposed simplification and a decision to retain the current design,
with the intended phrasing and progression rather than a required transcript.

Support that judgment with:

- Current and proposed shape, with both file trees when organization changes.
- Concrete file or caller evidence, the stronger invariant and its owner,
  and behavior that must survive.
- The concrete smaller alternative, deletion prize, complexity introduced,
  and any user loss or obligation. Explain why the alternative wins or loses.
- Which remaining tasks should change or disappear, if a plan exists.
- Verification that would distinguish improvement from displaced complexity,
  including assumptions that remain unproven.

Report correctness blockers separately so an attractive collapse cannot hide
a regression. Attribute verification failures using the agreed review baseline;
the code inspection skill owns that procedure. Do not call a failure pre-existing
without evidence.

## Adjudicate and continue

The coordinating agent reconciles both reviews into one recommendation,
preserving consequential disagreement. Verify findings against current artifacts
and accept, reject, or defer them with reasons; agreement is not a correctness
test. State the decisive claim behind a consequential recommendation, including
one synthesized from the two reviews. If neither reviewer tested that specific
alternative against the guarantee it must preserve, ask the reviewer best placed
to challenge it for a focused counterexample or the caller evidence that rules
one out. Verify the deciding fact directly; if it remains unproven, keep the
recommendation conditional. Do not start another full review to answer a
focused question.

Present the strongest opportunity, deletion prize, costs, and judgment
together so the user can assess the bargain. Keep reviewer inventories and
deliberation in the supporting evidence; the user should not have to reconstruct
the recommendation from two reports. An unresolved condition belongs beside
the recommendation, without making a promising direction sound settled.
Explain accepted findings before editing.
Implement and verify repairs within existing authorization; bring changes to
the accepted outcome or unresolved product judgment to the user.

After repairs, apply [post-implementation-review](../post-implementation-review/SKILL.md#output-shape)'s
local post-edit checks to every repaired file before closing the review.

When executing a plan, rewrite remaining work around the resulting design and
delete obsolete tasks. Record consequential findings and decisions in the active
plan or working notes. The assignment sets any intermediate review checkpoints.

Request a focused follow-up when repairs materially change reviewed ownership
or expose an unresolved risk. Close the review when grounded findings are
resolved and the next step has a defensible shape, then resume any remaining
assigned work. Do not repeat reviews to obtain a collapse or unanimous approval.

# Rename `whenSynced` to `whenReady`

**Author**: AI-assisted

## Overview

Rename the `Lifecycle.whenSynced` property to `whenReady` across the codebase. The current name implies network synchronization, but the promise actually means "this thing is ready to use"—which could be local persistence loaded, a database initialized, or just `Promise.resolve()` for extensions with no async work.

## Motivation

### Current State

The `Lifecycle` type in `packages/epicenter/src/shared/lifecycle.ts` defines the contract every extension and provider must satisfy:

```typescript
export type Lifecycle = {
	whenSynced: Promise<unknown>;
	destroy: () => MaybePromise<void>;
};
```

Every extension returns `whenSynced`. The workspace aggregates them:

```typescript
// create-workspace.ts
const whenSynced = Promise.all(
	Object.values(extensions).map((e) => (e as Lifecycle).whenSynced),
).then(() => {});
```

UI awaits the result as a render gate:

```typescript
// +layout.ts
const client = createWorkspaceClient(definition);
await client.whenSynced;
```

This creates problems:

1. **The name is misleading.** In `y-sweet-persist-sync.ts`, `whenSynced` resolves when local persistence loads. The WebSocket connects _after_ in the background. "Synced" implies network synchronization; the promise has nothing to do with that.

2. **The same name means different things.** In `y-sweet-connection.ts` (static workspace viewer), `whenSynced` resolves when the WebSocket connects—actual network sync. Same name, different semantic.

3. **It conflicts with Yjs vocabulary.** Yjs core (`Y.Doc`) has its own `whenSynced` that specifically means "network provider has synced with backend." Our `whenSynced` usually means the opposite: local data is loaded, network hasn't happened yet.

### Desired State

```typescript
export type Lifecycle = {
	whenReady: Promise<unknown>;
	destroy: () => MaybePromise<void>;
};
```

```typescript
await client.whenReady;
```

One name, one meaning: "this thing is ready to use."

## Research Findings

### Yjs Core's Two-Phase Readiness System

Yjs (since 2021/2023) provides two distinct concepts on `Y.Doc`:

| Property         | Meaning                                | Event  | Boolean        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------ | -------------- |
| `doc.whenLoaded` | Persistence provider loaded local data | `load` | `doc.isLoaded` |
| `doc.whenSynced` | Network provider synced with backend   | `sync` | `doc.isSynced` |

Kevin Jahns (Yjs author) designed these as separate phases: local load first, network sync second. The `load` event is emitted by persistence providers when they finish reading from storage. The `sync` event fires when a connection provider completes synchronization. If `sync` fires before `load`, Yjs automatically emits `load` too.

**Key finding**: Yjs deliberately separates "loaded from persistence" from "synced with network." Our `Lifecycle.whenSynced` conflates the two.

### y-indexeddb's Naming Confusion

y-indexeddb exposes `.whenSynced` on its `IndexeddbPersistence` instance, but this resolves when data is loaded from IndexedDB—not when anything is synced with a network. This is arguably a naming mistake in y-indexeddb itself. It predates Yjs core's `whenLoaded`/`whenSynced` distinction.

Our web persistence currently passes it through directly:

```typescript
// y-sweet-persist-sync/web.ts
return defineExports({
	whenSynced: idb.whenSynced, // y-indexeddb's "whenSynced" = local load
});
```

After the rename, this becomes an explicit adapter at the boundary:

```typescript
return defineExports({
	whenReady: idb.whenSynced, // Adapt y-indexeddb's name to our convention
});
```

This is actually clearer—it makes visible that y-indexeddb's concept and our concept are related but named differently.

### Why Not `whenLoaded`?

We considered aligning with Yjs's `whenLoaded` since most of our uses are persistence loading. Rejected because:

| Concern                                       | Explanation                                                                                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Not all extensions "load"                     | A pure computation extension or one that returns `defineExports()` with no async work doesn't load anything. `whenLoaded: Promise.resolve()` reads oddly. |
| The workspace aggregate isn't a "load"        | `workspace.whenReady` means "all extensions are initialized." That's readiness, not loading.                                                              |
| Yjs's own naming is tangled                   | y-indexeddb calls local load `whenSynced`. Yjs core calls it `whenLoaded`. Aligning with one half of this confusion doesn't help.                         |
| `whenReady` is already precedented internally | `content-doc-store.ts` already uses `whenReady` for the same concept.                                                                                     |

### Y-Sweet Provider Resilience

Y-Sweet's `YSweetProvider` has built-in resilience that interacts well with `whenReady`:

| Behavior                       | Detail                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Retry with exponential backoff | Reconnects automatically on failure                                |
| Token refresh                  | After 3 failed retries, refreshes auth token and retries           |
| Heartbeats                     | Sends sync status messages every 2s to detect dead connections     |
| Connection timeout             | Closes WebSocket after 3s without heartbeat response               |
| Browser online/offline events  | Resumes connection attempts when network comes back                |
| Status events                  | Emits `connecting`, `connected`, `error`, `handshaking`, `offline` |

The current `y-sweet-persist-sync.ts` extension already handles this correctly:

```typescript
const whenSynced = (async () => {
	const p = config.persistence({ ydoc });
	persistenceCleanup = p.destroy;
	await p.whenSynced;
	// WebSocket connects in background — don't await it.
	// Y-Sweet retries automatically. Status surfaced via provider events.
	provider.connect().catch(() => {});
})();
```

`whenReady` resolves when persistence loads (~10-20ms). The WebSocket is non-blocking. If the Y-Sweet server is down, `whenReady` still resolves. Y-Sweet retries in the background indefinitely. Connection status is reactive via `provider.on('connection-status', ...)`.

This is correct local-first behavior: show local data immediately, sync in the background, surface connection status reactively.

### Why `whenReady` Never Blocks Long (For Dynamic Workspaces)

Dynamic workspaces use the `ySweetPersistSync` extension (or will, once Y-Sweet sync is wired in). This extension orchestrates a two-phase startup inside a single `whenReady` promise:

```typescript
// y-sweet-persist-sync.ts
const whenReady = (async () => {
  await p.whenReady;              // Phase 1: local persistence load (~10-20ms)
  provider.connect().catch(…);    // Phase 2: WebSocket in background (non-blocking)
})();
```

`whenReady` resolves after Phase 1. The WebSocket is fire-and-forget. If the Y-Sweet server is down, unreachable, or slow, `whenReady` still resolves in milliseconds. Y-Sweet's provider handles retry with exponential backoff, token refresh, and heartbeats entirely in the background. Connection status is surfaced reactively via `provider.on('connection-status', ...)`.

This means `await workspace.whenReady` in a SvelteKit layout or Svelte `{#await}` block will never block the UI waiting for network. The user sees local data immediately; sync happens silently.

Currently, `createWorkspaceClient` (`apps/epicenter/src/lib/yjs/workspace.ts`) only wires up `workspacePersistence` (Tauri filesystem, no network sync). When Y-Sweet sync is added, the persistence-first pattern in `ySweetPersistSync` ensures `whenReady` stays fast.

### The 10-Second Timeout (Static Workspace Viewer Only)

The static workspace viewer (`workspaces/static/[id]/+layout.ts`) is a fundamentally different case. It uses `createYSweetConnection` directly—raw WebSocket, no local persistence:

```typescript
const connection = createYSweetConnection({ workspaceId, serverUrl });
await Promise.race([
	connection.whenReady,
	new Promise((_, reject) =>
		setTimeout(() => reject(new Error('Sync timeout')), 10000),
	),
]);
```

Since there's no local data to load, the viewer _must_ wait for the WebSocket to get any data at all. The 10-second timeout is a consumer-level policy for this specific case—it's not a concern for the `whenReady` abstraction itself.

This distinction matters: the timeout exists because the static viewer lacks a persistence layer, not because `whenReady` is slow. If the static viewer ever gains local caching (e.g., IndexedDB), its `whenReady` would resolve fast too.

Our `Lifecycle` is broader than Yjs (covers SQLite, filesystem, KV). A clean name avoids inheriting their confusion.                                                                                                     |

## Architecture

No architectural changes. The lifecycle flow remains:

```
Extension Factory (sync)
   │
   └─→ returns { whenReady, destroy, ...exports }
              │
              ▼
Workspace aggregates: Promise.all(extensions.map(e => e.whenReady))
              │
              ▼
Consumer awaits: await workspace.whenReady
              │
              ▼
UI renders
```

## Implementation Plan

- [x] **2.11** `packages/epicenter/src/filesystem/content-doc-store.test.ts`
- [x] **2.12** `packages/epicenter/src/static/types.ts`

### Phase 3: App Consumers

- [x] **4.8** Update `docs/articles/20260127T120000-static-workspace-api-guide.md`
- [x] **4.9** Update `docs/guides/yjs-persistence-guide.md` (our keys only; y-indexeddb right-side stays `whenSynced`)
- [x] **4.10** Update `docs/patterns/type-composition-across-platforms.md`
- [x] **4.11** Update `packages/epicenter/README.md`
- [x] **4.12** Update `packages/epicenter/src/static/define-workspace.test.ts`

### Phase 5: Verify

- [x] **5.1** `bun typecheck` passes (pre-existing errors in cli.test.ts and table-helper.ts unrelated to rename)
- [x] **5.2** `bun test` passes (811 pass, 0 fail)
- [x] **5.3** Grep for any remaining `whenSynced` in source files — only `web.ts:37` (`idb.whenSynced`, legitimate external API)

## Edge Cases

### y-indexeddb Boundary Adapter

After rename, the web persistence file becomes:

```typescript
return defineExports({
	whenReady: idb.whenSynced, // y-indexeddb's whenSynced = "data loaded from IndexedDB"
});
```

This is intentional. The comment documents the semantic mapping.

### Extensions With No Async Work

Extensions that return `defineExports()` or `defineExports({ helper })` without providing `whenReady` get `Promise.resolve()` as the default. This is correct: an extension with no async init is ready immediately.

### Static Workspace Timeout

The static layout's `Promise.race` with 10-second timeout continues to work identically. The only change is the property name.

### content-doc-store's Internal `whenReady`

`content-doc-store.ts` already uses `whenReady` as a local variable name for the same concept. After this rename, the local variable and the provider property name align, which is cleaner. No semantic change.

## Open Questions

1. **Should `y-sweet-connection.ts` use `whenReady` or should it use a different name?**
   - This is the one case where the promise means "WebSocket connected," not "local data loaded."
   - `whenReady` still works: the connection is "ready to use" when connected.
   - **Recommendation**: Use `whenReady`. The consumer (static layout) already wraps it with a timeout, so it's clearly understood as potentially slow.

2. **Should docs/articles be updated in this PR or separately?**
   - Updating docs is low-risk but makes the diff noisier.
   - **Recommendation**: Update articles in the same PR. They're closely tied to the API and stale docs are worse than a larger diff.

## Out of Scope / Follow-up

### Eliminate `createYSweetConnection` in favor of `ySweetPersistSync`

`apps/epicenter/src/lib/yjs/y-sweet-connection.ts` hand-rolls its own Y-Sweet lifecycle: manually creates a Y.Doc, a provider, and a `whenReady` promise using `Promise.withResolvers` + connection-status event listening. This duplicates what `ySweetPersistSync` already handles.

The static workspace viewer (`workspaces/static/[id]/+layout.ts`) is the sole consumer. It could use `ySweetPersistSync` directly:

```typescript
const ydoc = new Y.Doc({ guid: workspaceId });
const sync = ySweetPersistSync({
	auth: directAuth(syncUrl),
	persistence: indexeddbPersistence,
})({ ydoc });

await sync.whenReady;
```

This would:

1. Eliminate `createYSweetConnection` and `y-sweet-connection.ts` entirely
2. Give the static viewer IndexedDB caching for free (revisits load instantly from cache)
3. Remove the 10-second timeout concern (persistence loads fast; WebSocket syncs in background)
4. Unify both workspace types on the same `ySweetPersistSync` extension

`ySweetPersistSync`'s factory only destructures `{ ydoc }` from its context, so it works fine without a full `ExtensionContext`.

This is a behavioral change (adds IndexedDB caching, changes the lifecycle) and deserves its own spec or PR. Not included in the rename.

## Success Criteria

- [x] No remaining `whenSynced` in `.ts` source files (only `web.ts` with legitimate `idb.whenSynced`)
- [x] `bun typecheck` passes (pre-existing errors unrelated to rename)
- [x] `bun test` passes (811 pass, 0 fail)
- [ ] App builds successfully (`bun run build` in apps/epicenter) — not run (Tauri build requires native toolchain)
- [x] y-indexeddb adapter has explicit comment documenting the name mapping
- [x] `docs/articles/sync-construction-async-property-ui-render-gate-pattern.md` updated

## Review

### Summary

Pure rename of `Lifecycle.whenSynced` → `whenReady` across 31 files. No behavioral changes. The rename resolves naming confusion with Yjs core's `whenSynced` (which means network sync) — our promise means "ready to use" (usually local persistence loaded).

### Key Decision: y-indexeddb Boundary

The adapter in `web.ts` now reads `whenReady: idb.whenSynced` with a comment explaining the semantic mapping. This makes visible that y-indexeddb's concept ("data loaded from IndexedDB") maps to our concept ("ready to use"), despite the naming difference in the external library.

### What Was NOT Changed

- **Historical specs** — Left as-is per spec guidelines ("they document decisions at the time")
- **y-indexeddb external API references** — `idb.whenSynced`, `persistence.whenSynced`, `provider.whenSynced` in docs that refer to the external library's API
- **No behavioral changes** — Pure rename, no logic changes

### Verification

- `bun test` in `packages/epicenter`: 811 pass, 0 fail
- `bun typecheck`: Pre-existing errors in `cli.test.ts` and `table-helper.ts` unrelated to this rename
- Grep `.ts` for `whenSynced`: Only `web.ts` line 37 (`idb.whenSynced`) — legitimate external API reference

 * ## Extensions vs Providers
 *
 * - **Providers** (doc-level): True YJS providers for sync/persistence on raw Y.Docs
 *   (Head Doc, Registry Doc). Receive minimal context: `{ ydoc }`.
 *
 * - **Extensions** (workspace-level): Plugins that extend workspaces with features
 *   like SQLite queries, Markdown sync, revision history. Receive the client-so-far
 *   as context, including previously added extensions.
 *
 * Use `defineExports()` to wrap your extension's return value for lifecycle normalization.
